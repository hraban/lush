Lush is a shell that is accessible over HTTP instead of through a terminal
emulator.

It is not technically a (login) shell but it aims to provide the functionality
of logging in to a server with ssh.

The goal of lush is to reinvent interaction with an operating system. Currently
there are two major players: the command line and graphical shells. Lush is a
third option that leverages the webbrowser as the UI.

Download and run as follows:

$ go get github.com/hraban/lush
$ cd ${GOPATH%%:*}/src/github.com/hraban/lush
$ go run *.go

The code is available on github at https://github.com/hraban/lush
